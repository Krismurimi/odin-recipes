        <h2>Description</h2>
          <p>
            This famous dish invented by the Italian diaspora on 
            the East Coast of the United States is a meal inspired 
            by eggplant Parmesan (breaded eggplants in tomato sauce 
            and cheese) and Cottoleta (fried breaded chicken or veal
             served with sauce).
             The resulting dish is the perfect combination of 
             crispy breaded chicken, cheesy goodness, and tangy 
             tomato sauce. We use jarred sauce but you can make your own if you have the time.
          </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>4 boneless chicken breasts, about 1 1/2 pounds</li>
            <li>1 large egg </li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk </li>
            <li>1 cup seasoned breadcrumbs, preferably Italian flavored</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil </li>
            <li>8 slices mozzarella cheese </li>
            <li>1 (24-ounce) jar pasta sauce </li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese </li>
            <li>8 ounces spaghetti, or linguine</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
                Lightly grease a 9 x 13-inch baking dish.
                 Heat the oven to 350 F.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Put the chicken breasts between sheets of plastic wrap
                     and gently pound to about 1/2 inch in thickness.
                     Use a rolling pin or the flat side of a meat mallet.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and milk. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Place the seasoned breadcrumbs in a different wide and shallow bowl.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Dip the flattened chicken breasts in the milk and egg mixture and then in the seasoned breadcrumbs, turning each piece to coat it evenly. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    In a large skillet or saut√© pan heat 1-inch of olive oil over medium-high heat. Be careful not to burn it, as olive oil achieves the smoke point fairly fast.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Brown the chicken in the hot oil on both sides until golden brown, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Pour 1/3 of the pasta sauce at the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Place the fried chicken on top and use 7 mozzarella slices to cover the chicken. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Pour the remaining sauce over the chicken and cheese. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and add the 1 chopped remaining mozzarella slice on top. Bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, or until bubbly. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    While the chicken bakes, cook the spaghetti or linguine in boiling salted water following package directions. Drain well and toss with a little olive oil. Add sea salt if desired. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Serve the chicken with the spaghetti, bread, and a tossed green salad. Enjoy! </p>
